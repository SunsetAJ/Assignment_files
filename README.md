Files for my "final" website for submission.
The website is missing some elements like the rest of the courses and the quizs that go with that.
I think that the amount of javascript that I have put in makes up for that however.
All the javascript is my own, I did you jquery but that is only for the scroll to top function
in the courses page.
The page should be responsive enough to use on a mobile device, the only page that would need some
adjusting is the page the quizes are on, the font is too big and hard to read.
I did not get to add in a "virtual" Photoshop into the page but the tool-tip page and a small element
on it that was apart of the "virtual" Photoshop idea.
